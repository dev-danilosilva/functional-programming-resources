# Functional Programming Resources


## What is this repository about?

Learning a new preogramming paridigm, specially functional programming, can be a wonderful path of discoveries and new possibilities. But it can be hard a challenging as well. Because of it, I decided to share through this repositorie the materials I have been using to learn this amazing way of resoning about software development.

Here I will list some books, articles, videos and other materials to help you to find some cool stuff that is out there.

*You will see a lot of Haskell here, because it is my favorite functional programming language, but the principles and the ideas contained in this material can be mostly applied using whatever functional programming language you want.*
